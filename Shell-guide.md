# 1. Basic Shell Programming


The first line that you will write in bash script files is called `shebang`. This line in any script determines the script's ability to be executed like a standalone executable without typing sh, bash, python, php etc beforehand in the terminal.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

## 1.1. Variables

Creating variables in bash is similar to other languages. There are no data types. A variable in bash can contain a number, a character, a string of characters, etc. You have no need to declare a variable, just assigning a value to its reference will create it.

Example:
```bash
str="hello world"
```

The above line creates a variable `str` and assigns "hello world" to it. The value of variable is retrieved by putting the `$` in the beginning of variable name.

Example:
```bash
echo $str   # hello world
```
## 1.2. Array
Like other languages bash has also arrays. An array is a variable containing multiple values. There's no maximum limit on the size of array. Arrays in bash are zero based. The first element is indexed with element 0. There are several ways for creating arrays in bash which are given below.

Examples:
```bash
array[0]=val
array[1]=val
array[2]=val
array=([2]=val [0]=val [1]=val)
array=(val val val)
```
To display a value at specific index use following syntax:

```bash
${array[i]}     # where i is the index
```

If no index is supplied, array element 0 is assumed. To find out how many values there are in the array use the following syntax:

```bash
${#array[@]}
```

Bash has also support for the ternary conditions. Check some examples below.

```bash
${varname:-word}    # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise return word
${varname:=word}    # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise set it word and then return its value
${varname:+word}    # if varname exists and isn't null, return word; otherwise return null
${varname:offset:length}    # performs substring expansion. It returns the substring of $varname starting at offset and up to length characters
```

## 1.3 String Substitution

Check some of the syntax on how to manipulate strings

```bash
${variable#pattern}         # if the pattern matches the beginning of the variable's value, delete the shortest part that matches and return the rest
${variable##pattern}        # if the pattern matches the beginning of the variable's value, delete the longest part that matches and return the rest
${variable%pattern}         # if the pattern matches the end of the variable's value, delete the shortest part that matches and return the rest
${variable%%pattern}        # if the pattern matches the end of the variable's value, delete the longest part that matches and return the rest
${variable/pattern/string}  # the longest match to pattern in variable is replaced by string. Only the first match is replaced
${variable//pattern/string} # the longest match to pattern in variable is replaced by string. All matches are replaced
${#varname}     # returns the length of the value of the variable as a character string
```

## 1.4. Functions
As in almost any programming language, you can use functions to group pieces of code in a more logical way or practice the divine art of recursion. Declaring a function is just a matter of writing function my_func { my_code }. Calling a function is just like calling another program, you just write its name.

```bash
function name() {
    shell commands
}
```

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
function hello {
   echo world!
}
hello

function say {
    echo $1
}
say "hello world!"
```

When you run the above example the `hello` function will output "world!". The above two functions `hello` and `say` are identical. The main difference is function `say`. This function, prints the first argument it receives. Arguments, within functions, are treated in the same manner as arguments given to the script.

## 1.5. Conditionals

The conditional statement in bash is similar to other programming languages. Conditions have many form like the most basic form is `if` expression `then` statement where statement is only executed if expression is true.

```bash
if [ expression ]; then
    will execute only if expression is true
else
    will execute if expression is false
fi
```

Sometime if conditions becoming confusing so you can write the same condition using the `case statements`.

```bash
case expression in
    pattern1 )
        statements ;;
    pattern2 )
        statements ;;
    ...
esac
```

Expression Examples:

```bash
statement1 && statement2  # both statements are true
statement1 || statement2  # at least one of the statements is true

str1=str2       # str1 matches str2
str1!=str2      # str1 does not match str2
str1<str2       # str1 is less than str2
str1>str2       # str1 is greater than str2
-n str1         # str1 is not null (has length greater than 0)
-z str1         # str1 is null (has length 0)

-a file         # file exists
-d file         # file exists and is a directory
-e file         # file exists; same -a
-f file         # file exists and is a regular file (i.e., not a directory or other special type of file)
-r file         # you have read permission
-s file         # file exists and is not empty
-w file         # you have write permission
-x file         # you have execute permission on file, or directory search permission if it is a directory
-N file         # file was modified since it was last read
-O file         # you own file
-G file         # file's group ID matches yours (or one of yours, if you are in multiple groups)

file1 -nt file2     # file1 is newer than file2
file1 -ot file2     # file1 is older than file2

-lt     # less than
-le     # less than or equal
-eq     # equal
-ge     # greater than or equal
-gt     # greater than
-ne     # not equal
```

## 1.6. Loops

There are three types of loops in bash. `for`, `while` and `until`.

Different `for` Syntax:
```bash
for x := 1 to 10 do
begin
  statements
end

for name [in list]
do
  statements that can use $name
done

for (( initialisation ; ending condition ; update ))
do
  statements...
done
```

`while` Syntax:
```bash
while condition; do
  statements
done
```

`until` Syntax:
```bash
until condition; do
  statements
done
```
