# Code Submission Guidelines

We've enacted standards for commits and pull requests to effectively manage the project over
time. We expect all code contributed to follow these standards. If your code doesn't follow them, we
will kindly ask you to resubmit it in the correct format.

- [Submitting a pull request](#submitting-a-pull-request)
- [Merging a pull request](#merging-a-pull-request)
- [python guide](#guide-for-python)


## Submitting a pull request

We want to keep our commit log clean by avoiding merge messages in branches. Before submitting a pull request, make sure your branch is up to date with the develop branch by either:

- Pulling from develop before creating your branch
- Doing a rebase from origin/develop (will require a force push **on your branch**)

To rebase from origin/develop if we've pushed changes since you created your branch:

```sh
git checkout your-branch
git fetch
git rebase origin/develop
git push origin head -f
```
## Merging a pull request

If a pull request has many commits (especially if they don't follow our [commit policy](#git-commits)), you'll want to squash them into one clean commit.

In the Github UI, you can use the new [Squash and Merge](https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits) feature to make this easy. If there are merge conflicts preventing this, either ask the committer to rebase from develop following the [PR submission steps above](#submitting-a-pull-request), or use the manual method below.

To apply a pull request manually, make sure your local develop branch is up to date. Then, create a new branch for that pull request.

Create a temporary, local branch:

```sh
git checkout -b temp-feature-branch
```

Run the following commands to apply all commits from that pull request on top of your branch's local history:

```console
curl -L https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/pull/205.patch | git am -3
```

If the merge succeeds, use `git diff origin/develop` to review all the changes that will happen post-merge.

# Guide for python

## In General

### Values

- "Build tools for others that you want to be built for you." - Kenneth Reitz
- "Simplicity is alway better than functionality." - Pieter Hintjens
- "Fit the 90% use-case. Ignore the nay sayers." - Kenneth Reitz
- "Beautiful is better than ugly." - [PEP 20][]
- Build for open source (even for closed source projects).

### General Development Guidelines

- "Explicit is better than implicit" - [PEP 20][]
- "Readability counts." - [PEP 20][]
- "Anybody can fix anything." - [Khan Academy Development Docs][]
- Fix each [broken window](http://www.artima.com/intv/fixit2.html) (bad design, wrong decision, or poor code) *as soon as it is discovered*.
- "Now is better than never." - [PEP 20][]
- Test ruthlessly. Write docs for new features.
- Even more important that Test-Driven Development--*Human-Driven Development*
- These guidelines may--and probably will--change.

## In Particular

### Style

Follow [PEP 8][], when sensible.

#### Naming

- Variables, functions, methods, packages, modules
    - `lower_case_with_underscores`
- Classes and Exceptions
    - `CapWords`
- Protected methods and internal functions
    - `_single_leading_underscore(self, ...)`
- Private methods
    - `__double_leading_underscore(self, ...)`
- Constants
    - `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES`

###### General Naming Guidelines 

Avoid one-letter variables (esp. `l`, `O`, `I`). 

*Exception*: In very short blocks, when the meaning is clearly visible from the immediate context

**Fine**
```python
for e in elements:
    e.mutate()
```

Avoid redundant labeling.

**Yes**
```python
import audio

core = audio.Core()
controller = audio.Controller()
```

**No**
```python
import audio

core = audio.AudioCore()
controller = audio.AudioController()
```

Prefer "reverse notation".

**Yes**
```python
elements = ...
elements_active = ...
elements_defunct = ...
```

**No**
```python
elements = ...
active_elements = ...
defunct_elements ...
```

Avoid getter and setter methods.

**Yes**
```python
person.age = 42
```

**No**
```python
person.set_age(42)
```

#### Indentation

Use 4 spaces--never tabs. Enough said.

#### Imports

Import entire modules instead of individual symbols within a module. For example, for a top-level module `canteen` that has a file `canteen/sessions.py`,

**Yes**

```python
import canteen
import canteen.sessions
from canteen import sessions
```

**No**

```python
from canteen import get_user  # Symbol from canteen/__init__.py
from canteen.sessions import get_session  # Symbol from canteen/sessions.py
```

*Exception*: For third-party code where documentation explicitly says to import individual symbols.

*Rationale*: Avoids circular imports. See [here](https://sites.google.com/a/khanacademy.org/forge/for-developers/styleguide/python#TOC-Imports).

Put all imports at the top of the page with three sections, each separated by a blank line, in this order:

1. System imports
2. Third-party imports
3. Local source tree imports

*Rationale*: Makes it clear where each module is coming from.

#### Documentation

Follow [PEP 257][]'s docstring guidelines. [reStructured Text](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html) and [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) can help to enforce these standards.

Use one-line docstrings for obvious functions.

```python
"""Return the pathname of ``foo``."""
```

Multiline docstrings should include

- Summary line
- Use case, if appropriate
- Args
- Return type and semantics, unless ``None`` is returned

```python
"""Train a model to classify Foos and Bars.

Usage::

    >>> import klassify
    >>> data = [("green", "foo"), ("orange", "bar")]
    >>> classifier = klassify.train(data)

:param train_data: A list of tuples of the form ``(color, label)``.
:rtype: A :class:`Classifier <Classifier>`
"""
```

Notes

- Use action words ("Return") rather than descriptions ("Returns").
- Document `__init__` methods in the docstring for the class.

```python
class Person(object):
    """A simple representation of a human being.

    :param name: A string, the person's name.
    :param age: An int, the person's age.
    """
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

##### On comments

Use them sparingly. Prefer code readability to writing a lot of comments. Often, small methods are more effective than comments.

*No*

```python
# If the sign is a stop sign
if sign.color == 'red' and sign.sides == 8:
    stop()
```

*Yes*

```python
def is_stop_sign(sign):
    return sign.color == 'red' and sign.sides == 8

if is_stop_sign(sign):
    stop()
```

When you do write comments, remember: "Strunk and White apply." - [PEP 8][]

#### Line lengths

Don't stress over it. 80-100 characters is fine.

Use parentheses for line continuations.

```python
wiki = (
    "The Colt Python is a .357 Magnum caliber revolver formerly manufactured "
    "by Colt's Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut. It is sometimes "
    'referred to as a "Combat Magnum". It was first introduced in 1955, the '
    "same year as Smith & Wesson's M29 .44 Magnum."
)
```

### Testing

Strive for 100% code coverage, but don't get obsess over the coverage score.

#### General testing guidelines

- Use long, descriptive names. This often obviates the need for doctrings in test methods.
- Tests should be isolated. Don't interact with a real database or network. Use a separate test database that gets torn down or use mock objects.
- Prefer [factories](https://github.com/rbarrois/factory_boy) to fixtures.
- Never let incomplete tests pass, else you run the risk of forgetting about them. Instead, add a placeholder like `assert False, "TODO: finish me"`.

#### Unit Tests

- Focus on one tiny bit of functionality.
- Should be fast, but a slow test is better than no test.
- It often makes sense to have one testcase class for a single class or model.

```python
import unittest
import factories

class PersonTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.person = factories.PersonFactory()

    def test_has_age_in_dog_years(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.person.dog_years, self.person.age / 7)
```

#### Functional Tests

Functional tests are higher level tests that are closer to how an end-user would interact with your application. They are typically used for web and GUI applications.

- Write tests as scenarios. Testcase and test method names should read like a scenario description.
- Use comments to write out stories, *before writing the test code*.

```python
import unittest

class TestAUser(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_can_write_a_blog_post(self):
        # Goes to the her dashboard
        ...
        # Clicks "New Post"
        ...
        # Fills out the post form
        ...
        # Clicks "Submit"
        ...
        # Can see the new post
        ...
```

Notice how the testcase and test method read together like "Test A User can write a blog post".
